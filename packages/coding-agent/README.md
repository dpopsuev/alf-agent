## Attribution

**Alef** (`alef`, npm **`@alef/coding-agent`**) is a **fork** of **[Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono)** (**Pi Agent** / terminal coding harness). Pi was created by **[Mario Zechner](https://mariozechner.at)** ([@badlogic](https://github.com/badlogic)); upstream sources live in **[earendil-works/pi-mono](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono)**. The MIT-licensed implementation here builds on that work—credit for the original belongs to Mario and the Pi contributors.

**Alef** is maintained separately in **[dpopsuev/alef](https://github.com/dpopsuev/alef)** with Alef-specific scopes and defaults; behavior below follows Pi unless noted otherwise.

---

**Alef** is a minimal terminal coding harness. Adapt Alef to your workflows, not the other way around, without having to fork and modify core internals. Extend it with TypeScript [Extensions](#extensions), [Skills](#skills), [Prompt Templates](#prompt-templates), and [Themes](#themes). Put your extensions, skills, prompt templates, and themes in [Alef packages](#alef-packages) and share them with others via npm or git.

Alef ships with powerful defaults but skips features like sub agents and plan mode. Instead, you can ask Alef to build what you want or install a third-party package that matches your workflow.

Alef runs in four modes: interactive, print or JSON, RPC for process integration, and an SDK for embedding in your own apps. See [openclaw/openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) for a real-world SDK integration.

## Share your OSS coding agent sessions

If you use Alef or Pi for open source work, please share your coding agent sessions.

Public OSS session data helps improve models, prompts, tools, and evaluations using real development workflows.

For the full explanation, see [this post on X](https://x.com/badlogicgames/status/2037811643774652911).

To publish sessions, use [`badlogic/pi-share-hf`](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-share-hf). Read its README.md for setup instructions. All you need is a Hugging Face account, the Hugging Face CLI, and `pi-share-hf`.

You can also watch [this video](https://x.com/badlogicgames/status/2041151967695634619), where I show how I publish my `pi-mono` sessions.

I regularly publish my own `pi-mono` work sessions here:

- [badlogicgames/pi-mono on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/badlogicgames/pi-mono)

## Quick Start

Install the CLI globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g @alef/coding-agent
```

Authenticate with an API key:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
alef
```

Or use your existing subscription:

```bash
alef
/login  # Then select provider
```

Then just talk to Alef. By default, Alef exposes four tools to the model: `read`, `write`, `edit`, and `bash`. The model uses these to fulfill your requests. Add capabilities via [skills](#skills), [prompt templates](#prompt-templates), [extensions](#extensions), or [Alef packages](#alef-packages).

**Platform notes:** [Windows](docs/windows.md) | [Termux (Android)](docs/termux.md) | [tmux](docs/tmux.md) | [Terminal setup](docs/terminal-setup.md) | [Shell aliases](docs/shell-aliases.md)

---

## Providers & Models

For each built-in provider, Alef ships a list of tool-capable models, updated with every release. Authenticate via subscription (`/login`) or API key, then select any model from that provider via `/model` (or Ctrl+L).

**Subscriptions:**
- Anthropic Claude Pro/Max
- OpenAI ChatGPT Plus/Pro (Codex)
- GitHub Copilot

**API keys:**
- Anthropic
- OpenAI
- Azure OpenAI
- DeepSeek
- Google Gemini
- Google Vertex
- Amazon Bedrock
- Mistral
- Groq
- Cerebras
- Cloudflare AI Gateway
- Cloudflare Workers AI
- xAI
- OpenRouter
- Vercel AI Gateway
- ZAI
- OpenCode Zen
- OpenCode Go
- Hugging Face
- Fireworks
- Together AI
- Kimi For Coding
- MiniMax
- Xiaomi MiMo
- Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan (China)
- Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan (Amsterdam)
- Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan (Singapore)

See [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md) for detailed setup instructions.

**Custom providers & models:** Add providers via `<agent-dir>/models.json` if they speak a supported API (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). For custom APIs or OAuth, use extensions. See [docs/models.md](docs/models.md) and [docs/custom-provider.md](docs/custom-provider.md).

---

## Interactive Mode

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/interactive-mode.png" alt="Interactive Mode" width="600"></p>

The interface from top to bottom:

- **Startup header** - Shows shortcuts (`/hotkeys` for all), loaded AGENTS.md files, prompt templates, skills, and extensions
- **Messages** - Your messages, assistant responses, tool calls and results, notifications, errors, and extension UI
- **Editor** - Where you type; border color indicates thinking level
- **Footer** - Working directory, session name, total token/cache usage, cost, context usage, current model

The editor can be temporarily replaced by other UI, like built-in `/settings` or custom UI from extensions (e.g., a Q&A tool that lets the user answer model questions in a structured format). [Extensions](#extensions) can also replace the editor, add widgets above/below it, a status line, custom footer, or overlays.

### Editor

| Feature | How |
|---------|-----|
| File reference | Type `@` to fuzzy-search project files |
| Path completion | Tab to complete paths |
| Multi-line | Shift+Enter (or Ctrl+Enter on Windows Terminal) |
| Images | Ctrl+V to paste (Alt+V on Windows), or drag onto terminal |
| Bash commands | `!command` runs and sends output to LLM, `!!command` runs without sending |

Standard editing keybindings for delete word, undo, etc. See [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md).

### Commands

Type `/` in the editor to trigger commands. [Extensions](#extensions) can register custom commands, [skills](#skills) are available as `/skill:name`, and [prompt templates](#prompt-templates) expand via `/templatename`.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/login`, `/logout` | OAuth authentication |
| `/model` | Switch models |
| `/scoped-models` | Enable/disable models for Ctrl+P cycling |
| `/settings` | Thinking level, theme, message delivery, transport |
| `/resume` | Pick from previous sessions |
| `/new` | Start a new session |
| `/name <name>` | Set session display name |
| `/session` | Show session info (file, ID, messages, tokens, cost) |
| `/tree` | Jump to any point in the session and continue from there |
| `/fork` | Create a new session from a previous user message |
| `/clone` | Duplicate the current active branch into a new session |
| `/compact [prompt]` | Manually compact context, optional custom instructions |
| `/copy` | Copy last assistant message to clipboard |
| `/export [file]` | Export session to HTML file |
| `/share` | Upload as private GitHub gist with shareable HTML link |
| `/reload` | Reload keybindings, extensions, skills, prompts, and context files (themes hot-reload automatically) |
| `/hotkeys` | Show all keyboard shortcuts |
| `/changelog` | Display version history |
| `/quit` | Quit alef |

### Keyboard Shortcuts

See `/hotkeys` for the full list. Customize via `<agent-dir>/keybindings.json`. See [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md).

**Commonly used:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Ctrl+C | Clear editor |
| Ctrl+C twice | Quit |
| Escape | Cancel/abort |
| Escape twice | Open `/tree` |
| Ctrl+L | Open model selector |
| Ctrl+P / Shift+Ctrl+P | Cycle scoped models forward/backward |
| Shift+Tab | Cycle thinking level |
| Ctrl+O | Collapse/expand tool output |
| Ctrl+T | Collapse/expand thinking blocks |

### Message Queue

Submit messages while the agent is working:

- **Enter** queues a *steering* message, delivered after the current assistant turn finishes executing its tool calls
- **Alt+Enter** queues a *follow-up* message, delivered only after the agent finishes all work
- **Escape** aborts and restores queued messages to editor
- **Alt+Up** retrieves queued messages back to editor

On Windows Terminal, `Alt+Enter` is fullscreen by default. Remap it in [docs/terminal-setup.md](docs/terminal-setup.md) so Alef can receive the follow-up shortcut.

Configure delivery in [settings](docs/settings.md): `steeringMode` and `followUpMode` can be `"one-at-a-time"` (default, waits for response) or `"all"` (delivers all queued at once). `transport` selects provider transport preference (`"sse"`, `"websocket"`, or `"auto"`) for providers that support multiple transports.

---

## Sessions

Sessions are stored as JSONL files with a tree structure. Each entry has an `id` and `parentId`, enabling in-place branching without creating new files. See [docs/session-format.md](docs/session-format.md) for file format.

### Management

Sessions auto-save to `<agent-dir>/sessions/` organized by working directory.

```bash
alef -c                  # Continue most recent session
alef -r                  # Browse and select from past sessions
alef --no-session        # Ephemeral mode (don't save)
alef --session <path|id> # Use specific session file or ID
alef --fork <path|id>    # Fork specific session file or ID into a new session
```

Use `/session` in interactive mode to see the current session ID before reusing it with `--session <id>` or `--fork <id>`.

### Branching

**`/tree`** - Navigate the session tree in-place. Select any previous point, continue from there, and switch between branches. All history preserved in a single file.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/tree-view.png" alt="Tree View" width="600"></p>

- Search by typing, fold/unfold and jump between branches with Ctrl+←/Ctrl+→ or Alt+←/Alt+→, page with ←/→
- Filter modes (Ctrl+O): default → no-tools → user-only → labeled-only → all
- Press Shift+L to label entries as bookmarks and Shift+T to toggle label timestamps

**`/fork`** - Create a new session file from a previous user message on the active branch. Opens a selector, copies the active path up to that point, and places the selected prompt in the editor for modification.

**`/clone`** - Duplicate the current active branch into a new session file at the current position. The new session keeps the full active-path history and opens with an empty editor.

**`--fork <path|id>`** - Fork an existing session file or partial session UUID directly from the CLI. This copies the full source session into a new session file in the current project.

### Compaction

Long sessions can exhaust context windows. Compaction summarizes older messages while keeping recent ones.

**Manual:** `/compact` or `/compact <custom instructions>`

**Automatic:** Enabled by default. Triggers on context overflow (recovers and retries) or when approaching the limit (proactive). Configure via `/settings` or `settings.json`.

Compaction is lossy. The full history remains in the JSONL file; use `/tree` to revisit. Customize compaction behavior via [extensions](#extensions). See [docs/compaction.md](docs/compaction.md) for internals.

---

## Settings

`<agent-dir>` is your global Alef config root (sessions, auth, settings, etc.):

- **Linux:** `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alef/agent` (usually `~/.config/alef/agent`). If `~/.alef/agent` already exists, that directory is used instead.
- **macOS and Windows:** `~/.alef/agent`
- **Override:** set `ALEF_CODING_AGENT_DIR`

Project-local overrides live under `.alef/` in the repo root (for example `.alef/settings.json`).

Use `/settings` to modify common options, or edit JSON files directly:

| Location | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| `<agent-dir>/settings.json` | Global (all projects) |
| `.alef/settings.json` | Project (overrides global) |

See [docs/settings.md](docs/settings.md) for all options.

### Telemetry and update checks

Alef does **not** call third-party homepages by default.

- **Update check:** runs only when **`ALEF_LATEST_VERSION_URL`** is set to an HTTPS URL that returns JSON like `{ "version": "1.2.3" }`. Otherwise no request is made. Set **`ALEF_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK=1`** to skip even when a URL is configured.
- **Install/update telemetry:** sends a GET only when **`ALEF_REPORT_INSTALL_URL`** is set **and** install telemetry is enabled (`enableInstallTelemetry` in settings, default on, overridable with **`ALEF_TELEMETRY`**).

Use **`--offline`** or **`ALEF_OFFLINE=1`** to disable startup checks that hit the network (including package update checks that talk to registries).

---

## Context Files

Alef loads `AGENTS.md` (or `CLAUDE.md`) at startup from:
- `<agent-dir>/AGENTS.md` (global)
- Parent directories (walking up from cwd)
- Current directory

Use for project instructions, conventions, common commands. All matching files are concatenated.

Disable context file loading with `--no-context-files` (or `-nc`).

### System Prompt

Replace the default system prompt with `.alef/SYSTEM.md` (project) or `<agent-dir>/SYSTEM.md` (global). Append without replacing via `APPEND_SYSTEM.md`.

---

## Customization

### Prompt Templates

Reusable prompts as Markdown files. Type `/name` to expand.

```markdown
<!-- <agent-dir>/prompts/review.md -->
Review this code for bugs, security issues, and performance problems.
Focus on: {{focus}}
```

Place in `<agent-dir>/prompts/`, `.alef/prompts/`, or an [Alef package](#alef-packages) to share with others. See [docs/prompt-templates.md](docs/prompt-templates.md).

### Skills

On-demand capability packages following the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io). Invoke via `/skill:name` or let the agent load them automatically.

```markdown
<!-- <agent-dir>/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md -->
# My Skill
Use this skill when the user asks about X.

## Steps
1. Do this
2. Then that
```

Place in `<agent-dir>/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/`, `.alef/skills/`, or `.agents/skills/` (from `cwd` up through parent directories) or an [Alef package](#alef-packages) to share with others. See [docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md).

### Extensions

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/doom-extension.png" alt="Doom Extension" width="600"></p>

TypeScript modules that extend Alef with custom tools, commands, keyboard shortcuts, event handlers, and UI components.

```typescript
export default function (alef: ExtensionAPI) {
  alef.registerTool({ name: "deploy", ... });
  alef.registerCommand("stats", { ... });
  alef.on("tool_call", async (event, ctx) => { ... });
}
```

The default export can also be `async`. Alef waits for async extension factories before startup continues, which is useful for one-time initialization such as fetching remote model lists before calling `alef.registerProvider()`.

**What's possible:**
- Custom tools (or replace built-in tools entirely)
- Sub-agents and plan mode
- Custom compaction and summarization
- Permission gates and path protection
- Custom editors and UI components
- Status lines, headers, footers
- Git checkpointing and auto-commit
- SSH and sandbox execution
- MCP server integration
- Make Alef look like Claude Code
- Games while waiting (yes, Doom runs)
- ...anything you can dream up

Place in `<agent-dir>/extensions/`, `.alef/extensions/`, or an [Alef package](#alef-packages) to share with others. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md) and [examples/extensions/](examples/extensions/).

### Themes

Built-in: `dark`, `light`. Themes hot-reload: modify the active theme file and Alef applies changes immediately.

Place in `<agent-dir>/themes/`, `.alef/themes/`, or an [Alef package](#alef-packages) to share with others. See [docs/themes.md](docs/themes.md).

### Alef packages

Bundle and share extensions, skills, prompts, and themes via npm or git. Find packages on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3Aalf-package) or upstream-compatible listings tagged [`pi-package`](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3Api-package), or ask on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1456806362351669492/1457744485428629628).

> **Security:** Packages run with full system access. Extensions execute arbitrary code, and skills can instruct the model to perform any action including running executables. Review source code before installing third-party packages.

```bash
alef install npm:@foo/alef-tools
alef install npm:@foo/alef-tools@1.2.3      # pinned version
alef install git:github.com/user/repo
alef install git:github.com/user/repo@v1  # tag or commit
alef install git:git@github.com:user/repo
alef install git:git@github.com:user/repo@v1  # tag or commit
alef install https://github.com/user/repo
alef install https://github.com/user/repo@v1      # tag or commit
alef install ssh://git@github.com/user/repo
alef install ssh://git@github.com/user/repo@v1    # tag or commit
alef remove npm:@foo/alef-tools
alef uninstall npm:@foo/alef-tools          # alias for remove
alef list
alef update                               # update Alef and packages (skips pinned packages)
alef update --extensions                  # update packages only
alef update --self                        # update Alef only
alef update --self --force                # reinstall Alef even if current
alef update npm:@foo/alef-tools             # update one package
alef config                               # enable/disable extensions, skills, prompts, themes
```

Packages install to `<agent-dir>/git/` (git) or global npm. Use `-l` for project-local installs (`.alef/git/`, `.alef/npm/`). Git packages install dependencies with `npm install --omit=dev` by default, so runtime deps must be listed under `dependencies`; when `npmCommand` is configured, git packages use plain `install` for compatibility with wrappers. If you use a Node version manager and want package installs to reuse a stable npm context, set `npmCommand` in `settings.json`, for example `["mise", "exec", "node@20", "--", "npm"]`.

Create a package by adding an `alef` key to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-alef-package",
  "keywords": ["alef-package"],
  "alef": {
    "extensions": ["./extensions"],
    "skills": ["./skills"],
    "prompts": ["./prompts"],
    "themes": ["./themes"]
  }
}
```

Without an `alef` manifest, Alef auto-discovers from conventional directories (`extensions/`, `skills/`, `prompts/`, `themes/`).

See [docs/packages.md](docs/packages.md).

---

## Programmatic Usage

### SDK

```typescript
import { AuthStorage, createAgentSession, ModelRegistry, SessionManager } from "@alef/coding-agent";

const authStorage = AuthStorage.create();
const modelRegistry = ModelRegistry.create(authStorage);
const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  sessionManager: SessionManager.inMemory(),
  authStorage,
  modelRegistry,
});

await session.prompt("What files are in the current directory?");
```

For advanced multi-session runtime replacement, use `createAgentSessionRuntime()` and `AgentSessionRuntime`.

See [docs/sdk.md](docs/sdk.md) and [examples/sdk/](examples/sdk/).

### RPC Mode

For non-Node.js integrations, use RPC mode over stdin/stdout:

```bash
alef --mode rpc
```

RPC mode uses strict LF-delimited JSONL framing. Clients must split records on `\n` only. Do not use generic line readers like Node `readline`, which also split on Unicode separators inside JSON payloads.

See [docs/rpc.md](docs/rpc.md) for the protocol.

---

## Philosophy

Pi upstream design is aggressively extensible so core workflows stay minimal; Alef inherits that. Features other tools bake in can be built with [extensions](#extensions), [skills](#skills), or installed from third-party [Alef packages](#alef-packages). This keeps the core small while letting you shape Alef to fit how you work.

**No MCP.** Build CLI tools with READMEs (see [Skills](#skills)), or build an extension that adds MCP support. [Why?](https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-02-what-if-you-dont-need-mcp/)

**No sub-agents.** There's many ways to do this. Spawn Alef instances via tmux, or build your own with [extensions](#extensions), or install a package that does it your way.

**No permission popups.** Run in a container, or build your own confirmation flow with [extensions](#extensions) inline with your environment and security requirements.

**No plan mode.** Write plans to files, or build it with [extensions](#extensions), or install a package.

**No built-in to-dos.** They confuse models. Use a TODO.md file, or build your own with [extensions](#extensions).

**No background bash.** Use tmux. Full observability, direct interaction.

Read the [blog post](https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-30-pi-coding-agent/) for the full rationale.
